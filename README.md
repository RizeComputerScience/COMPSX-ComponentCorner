# Component Corner

This repository contains exemplar solutions to the ComponentCorner website that students will create in COMPS X: Application Development II: Frontend in Assignments 2, 3, 4, and 5. The solutions can be found on the following branches:
- `main`: Solutions to Assignments 2 and 3
- `assignment-4`: Solutions to Assignment 4
- `assignment-5`: Solutions to Assignment 5

These are just one example of many possible implementations of the assignment brief, so they should not be used as the "only" correct answer. Rather, they are a useful jumping off point to understand the type of work a top student should be submitting.
